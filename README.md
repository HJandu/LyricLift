## <a id="userstory-header"></a> User Story
Music is a worldwide phenomenon that spreads across countries and languages. Even when a language barrier exists, people still find themselves listening to music in languages they do not understand. Sometimes the flow, rhythm and sound of the language can be beautiful, even if the lyrics are not understood. Or they purely just relate to the music, rather than the words. However, there is always a percentage of people who are curious to understand the lyrics. This is where LyricLift is needed.
